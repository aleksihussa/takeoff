# Takeoff ðŸš€  
*Master of all shell scripts...*

The **takeoff.sh** that turns a barren TTY into a full-blown developerâ€™s cockpit faster than you can type `:wq`.  
No GUI? No problem.  
From zero to code-ready with vim, tmux, LSPs, and caffeine-grade automation.

Whether you're spawning a new dev environment in a fresh VM, on a server, or a Raspberry Pi in the middle of nowhere, **Takeoff** gives you the flying start you deserve.

One script to rule them all.  
One terminal to bind them.
